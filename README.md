# CloudFormation Deploy to S3

Deploy and publish Frontend SPA apps, UI components, static websites and MicroFrontends to S3 and Serverless Application Repository using this Lambda Layer component.

For more information, see [How to use CloudFormation to deploy Frontend Apps to S3 and Serverless Application Repository](https://serverless.pub/deploy-frontend-to-s3-and-sar/).

## Publishing Application Repo

To publish the application repo, run on the root folder:

`make publish DEPLOYMENT_BUCKET_NAME=<s3 cloudformation deployment bucket>`

## Deploying the example

There is a full example of a website to be deployed to S3 in the `example` directory, including applying substitutions to files.

To deploy it, in the `example` directory, run:

`make deploy STACK_NAME=<name of cf stack> DEPLOYMENT_BUCKET_NAME=<s3 cloudformation deployment bucket>`
